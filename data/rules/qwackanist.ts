  `Greetings, young Qwacker, and welcome to the sacred chamber of the Qwackanist â€“ the crucible where your
          memory shall be tested and tempered! I am the conduit of spells, the custodian of incantations, and I shall
          guide you through the trial that awaits.`,

  `Listen closely, for within my vast repository of magical utterances, lies the essence of your challenge. You
          are to discern, with razor-sharp acumen, whether the spell I weave into the air is one you've heard
          before. Your task is to sift through the annals of your mind and decide - has this spell graced your ears in
          a previous encounter, or is it a virgin utterance?`,

  `Be warned, the path ahead holds no room for faltering. A single misstep, one erroneous judgment, and the
          game shall slip from your grasp like water through a beak. Your success hinges upon the precision of your
          memory and the attentiveness of your spirit.`,

  `Two modes shall guide your journey: The "Mini Qwacker" where single-word spells dance upon the
          air, and the "Master Qwacker" where the complexity deepens with spells of two words and where you
          are compared to your Qwacker peers. Choose your challenge, embrace your destiny.`,

  `As the incantations flow from my beak, hold fast to the threads of recollection. When I have unspooled the
          entire tapestry of spells, a new cycle begins, each spell considered afresh - a test of your true mastery
          over memory.`,

  `So, heed this counsel: Listen with intent, recall with purpose, and decide with unwavering conviction. Step
          forth, noble Qwacker, and let the trial begin! Your mind shall be your guide, and the spells your
          companions. May your judgment be keen and your memory unwavering.`,
