  `Welcome to the realm of fragmented minds, where visions and monsters intertwine in a dance of chaos. I am the Psychoqwack, a conductor of madness and memory, and I shall guide you through a trial that dances on the precipice of sanity.`,

  `Listen well, for the rules of this twisted odyssey mirror the labyrinth of my own thoughts. Behold, a symphony of monsters – a parade of twisted visions etched into these cursed cards. Your task, brave wanderer, is to unveil two cards at a time, seeking to unravel the twisted echoes of matching pairs.`,

  `As you embark on this journey through the haunted gallery, remember that each level shall bear its own array of monstrous reflections. You must conquer them all to proceed to the next stage, your memories tested by the relentless tide of the unknown.`,

  `Two modes beckon your courage: The "Mini Qwacker," where you regain chances to falter with each new level, up to 3 chances granted, and the "Master Qwacker," where your chances are limited to a mere 3 for the entirety of this dark ordeal. Choose your path, but tread carefully, for each mismatched pair is a step towards oblivion.`,

  `But take heed – should the shadows conspire to lead you astray thrice, the doors to this realm shall close, the echoes of monsters fading into the void. And remember, the balance of your global score hangs in the balance – each successful match adds to your tally, while each discordant pair subtracts from it.`,

  `Now, venture forth into the realm of the demented, where monsters await their counterpart, and chaos reigns supreme. Let the flashes of memory guide your choices, and may your instincts be sharp, your resolve unyielding, and your memory unwavering.`,
