  `Ah, welcome, aspiring potion-brewer, to the mystical Qwackemist laboratory – a realm where the art of concoction intertwines with the tendrils of memory! I am the Alchemist of ingredients, the keeper of chronology, and I shall guide you through a trial that shall test your ability to weave the fabric of time within the elixirs of creation.`,
  `Listen closely, for the rules of this alchemical endeavor are as nuanced as they are exhilarating. I shall present before you a series of ingredients – an incantation of elements that together form the essence of our potions. Your task, as the brewer-in-training, is to discern the most recent addition among them, as if your memory were a cauldron bubbling with anticipation.`,
  `As you embark upon this journey of alchemical remembrance, remember that with each accurate selection, the potion shall evolve, growing one ingredient richer with every cycle. A symphony of aroma and essence shall flourish, a testament to your mastery over the art of recollection.`,
  `Two modes beckon your skill: The "Mini Qwacker," where the potions are simple and composed of up to 10 ingredients, and the "Master Qwacker," where the concoctions grow intricate with up to 20 ingredients. Choose your challenge wisely, for each mode offers its own potion of rewards.`,
  `Yet, heed this warning – should a single misjudgment color the brew with discord, the potion shall be spilled, the sequence reset, and your journey's concoction shall conclude. A single mistake could curdle the essence.`,
  `So, let the fragrances of memory guide your intuition, let the aromas of ingredients waft through your mind. When the time comes to select the freshest note in this symphony of elements, may your instincts be sharp, your senses acute, and your memory unwavering.`,
